                        my baby, and this is one of theem >< Its also my form of pambawi from not greeting you well
                            during your birthday.. :( Eto talaga bb HAHA even if its nerdy and unusual, its still full
                            of my effort, and that's what matters, riight? ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º Kahit hindi to hand-made irl, it still

                                                    those fights :< I feel from us that we really do grow from each
                                                    other, and I'll always treasure us. I didnâ€™t make a wrong choice to
